For two human players:

p1 =[];
p2 = [];
cards = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3];
p1turn =true;
p2turn=false;

#we need to link the TDs from a html table to a index in the array cards.
#the array items should get shuffle in each new game

changeturn () ->> we copy the system from tic tac toe. Later, we can add that if the "player" got a pair he got a extra turn

play()
    event.listener -> on click:
    inner.html =  cardx
    selection1 = card selected 
    
    event.listener -> on click:
    inner.html =  cardx
    selection 2 = card selected

    if selection1 == selection2:
        p1 push in selection 1
        cards pop selection 1
    else:
        innerhtml = "empty"
